						<p class="text-dark">You probably have been hearing this phrase before– Drupal 7
							end-of-life. Maybe you just joined your organization as a new marketer lead or CTO. You
							just learned that the core digital system responsible for engagement with your audience
							is about to stop receiving all security support. If you have been working with Drupal
							for many years and you are happy with it, you might like to continue working with it
							because of its flexibility and powerful editorial tools. Regardless of your
							circumstances, if you are still on Drupal 7 it’s time to seriously consider migrating to
							most recent version - Drupal 10.</p>

						<h4>What is Drupal? </h4>
						<p class="text-dark">Drupal is a modern open-source Content Management System or CMS. It's a
							system that allows non-technical users to efficiently use a website platform without
							having to write any code.</p>

						<p class="text-dark">In the current digital landscape, CMSs like Drupal are the go-to tools
							for organizations to manage their marketing efforts online. Businesses of all sizes
							prefer Drupal as their CMS for several reasons: it’s cost-effective, highly secure, and
							it has a dynamic community of developers and consultants.</p>

						<h4>What does Drupal 7 End-of-life mean? </h4>
						<p class="text-dark">The term “End-of-life" doesn't mean your CMS will suddenly stop
							working. It only means it will stop receiving security and performance updates as well
							as any new features rolled out in future releases. If an organization were to choose to
							stay on Drupal 7 after January 5, 2025, they should be made aware of the risk. Staying
							with this CMS increases potential exposure to cyber-attacks that would compromise any
							website. </p>

						<h4>What are the benefits of upgrading to Drupal 10? </h4>
						<p class="text-dark">It has been well known that the early versions of Drupal have been
							historically difficult
							to upgrade. Every time new release would come out it felt like a complete rebuild.
							Luckily, Drupal core contributors have been able to simplify previously complicated
							upgrading process from one version to another. Starting with Drupal 8, the transition
							has become much easier, making it a great investment for years to come. </p>

						<p class="text-dark">Drupal team has improved many aspects of its core system like caching,
							security,
							configuration management, SEO performance. While the concepts stayed the same the admin
							interface for Drupal 10 has improved a lot and became more flexible and user friendly.
						</p>

						<p class="text-dark">If you are planning to continue using Drupal in the future, the best
							logical decision is
							to upgrade your system to Drupal 10 (current version). </p>

						<h4>How long will it take to migrate from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10?</h4>

						<p class="text-dark">Migrating from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10 can be a complex project. The
							duration can vary
							depending on complexity and size of your application. It is important to first conduct a
							sophisticated audit of the current site to ensure a successful transition. </p>

						<p class="text-dark">For smaller projects that don’t use a lot of custom modules and
							integrations it may take
							as long as couple of weeks. While bigger websites with extensive customization may
							require several months of planning, preparation, and execution. The amount of content
							can also dictate the duration of the upgrade. Websites with substantial amount of
							content, users, files and other entities will typically take much longer for careful
							planning and execution. </p>

						<p class="text-dark">A good amount of time should be also spent on comprehensive testing and
							quality assurance
							of updated functionality, performance and security. </p>
